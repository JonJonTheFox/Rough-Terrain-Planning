# Tasks for Next Week
*From the meeting on October 21, 2024*

## Title title something something
1. Develop a model.
2. Perform training and validation on "good" voxels, which we will label ourselves.
3. Test on the entire dataset and analyze the results for all voxels.


### Notes
- Our goal : Create train/val data for the model, optimizing all parameters (vox. size, label-isation logic, label mapping ...) using a parameter file, and to analyse our results
- Example : histogram (number of voxel) by the points per voxel, ...
